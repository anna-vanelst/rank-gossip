```

## Getting Started

Install requirements using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run an experiment called "exp", you can simply use the following 
```bash
python run_experiments.py --exp_name "exp"
```

To generate a figure called "plot" from the paper, you can use the following
```bash
python run_figures.py --plot_name "plot"
```

## Reproducing the Figures

* **Figure (a)**

  * Plot name: `exp_async`
  * Required experiment: `exp_async`

* **Figure (b)**

  * Plot name: `exp_stat`
  * Required experiments: `exp_stat`, `exp_stat_ws`, `exp_stat_geo`

* **Figure (c)**

  * Plot name: `exp_trim`
  * Required experiment: `exp_trim`
